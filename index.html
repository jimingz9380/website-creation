                    <p> The Merbear is a new species of bear that is quite unique compared to the other types of bears.
                    It became a new species shortly after the polar bears went extinct. Studies have shown that as the Arctic
                    melted, polar bears slowly started disappearing till it under-go Natural Selection from a random mutation
                    which allows a bear to be born with fins better for surviving underwater. As time went on more of the polar
                    bears took the features of a fish allowing it to have a slimmer body, less fur, back legs turned into fins,
                    and gills. This allowed the bears to fully live underwater and use their front paws which still exist
                    as good tools for hunting. The bear could only reach the Twilight Zone of the ocean and can’t go any further
                    due to the lack of light.

                    The Merbear have been living in what was the Arctic now became part of the Arctic Ocean for about 100 years.
                    Just like their predecessor, Ursus maritimus(polar bears) who had also adapted to the cold temperature, the Merbear 
                    had adapted to the abundance of water but lack of land. The reason for this lack of land would be when there was extreme 
                    heating that had happened 250 years ago over at the arctic which caused the majority of the glaciers to melt down and made 
                    the polar bears have a competition between each other over who can get to their prey first. After news was spread about this 
                    competition, scientists all over the world had made attempts to preserve this species by mutating them with some aspects of 
                    sea animals. This lead to a gradual change in these polar bears which from natural selection change them to what you see as a 
                    Merbear.

                    the only environment it can try to live in is the ocean. Now it still lives in the Antarctic, but mostly in the ocean
                    where there is only water and barely any icey land anymore.

                    <p> The habitat the Merbear lives in is in abundance of water as the former Arctic now part of the Arctic Ocean in cold 
                    temperatures as they recovered back from the extreme heating. In this abundance of water there are many species of sea animals 
                    spread from each other but the Merbear usually remains where it used to remain when they were polar bears. As for their 
                    population they seem to remain at a plateau as even though they seem menacing in the sea, they still have conflict. One of 
                    them being is that they are in a constant competition between the sharks in the arctic which seems to make their habitat very
                    chaotic with.

                    <p> The Merbear’s main food source is hunting for Fish.  Some of the Merbear’s predator are Wolves and Walruses. They are 
                    surrounded in the living environment in the arctic where the Mearbear will have to make the best out of. For instance, there 
                    are 240 different fish species which is enough for Mearbear’s to consume.  In other words
